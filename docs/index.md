# Performance Task Submission

You goal for this week should be to wrap up your Create Task and start putting your "presentation" together. There are three parts to the Create Task submission:
* A **video** demonstrating your app.
* An annotated **pdf** of your code for the app. The annotations show the code that implements your abstraction, and algorithms.
* A **pdf** of your answers to the written response prompts.

The submission deadline is **Tuesday evening, May 26th, at 8:59 PM PDT.**

## Recording Your Video

There are a **lot** of ways to make a screen recording, you can find descriptions of them in the Code.Org tech tips document and also on the College Board YouTube channel.

The easisest option may be to use Zoom:
1. Go to your app - usually this will mean going to your project on Code.Org ([Create PT: Lesson 3 - Complete the Task](https://studio.code.org/s/csp-create-2019/stage/3/puzzle/2)) and practice showing how it works. Imagine showing it for the first time to a friend – you could even do this live with someone in your household. Your demo should take no more than a minute. When you're feeling ready...
1. Launch Zoom
1. Click on the orange **New** button to start a meeting (it will be a meeting with just you).
1. Click on the green **Share Screen** button, then select your app window (on the **Basic** tab) or an area of your screen (on the **Advanced** tab), finally click the blue **Share** button (or arrange the viewport if you selected a region of the screen on the Advanced tab).
1. In the Zoom menu bar click on **Record** and choose **Record on this Computer** (or type **Shift-Control-R** on Windows / **Shift-Command-R** on macOS) to start recording. You may need to first click on the **...** button to see the Record options.
1. When you are done, end the recording by typing **Shift-Control-R**.
1. End the Zoom meeting and your recording will be saved. A file selector window should open with the most recent recording selected.

## Editing the Video

The College Board limits your video for the Create Task to **one minute** and **30 MB**. To play it safe, I would say 59 seconds and 29 MB. A one minute Zoom video should be comfortably under 30 MB.

The only editing that you *need* to do is to make sure you elimate an material before you start your demonstration and after the end – and to keep it to under a minute.

### Windows 10

There is a video editor built in to the Windows **Photos** app. To launch it:

* Right-click on your video and select open with **Photos**.
* Check out [How to Use Windows 10’s Hidden Video Editor](https://www.howtogeek.com/355524/how-to-use-windows-10s-hidden-video-editor/) for more information.
