# Performance Task Submission

You goal for this week should be to wrap up your Create Task and start putting your "presentation" together. There are three parts to the Create Task submission:
* A **video** demonstrating your app.
* An annotated **pdf** of your code for the app. The annotations show the code that implements your abstraction, and algorithms.
* A **pdf** of your answers to the written response prompts.

The submission deadline is **Tuesday evening, May 26th, at 8:59 PM PDT.**
